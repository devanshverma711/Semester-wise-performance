contains graphs,piechart
Perform following operations on the DF:                                                                                                                                            1. calculate total marks of each student                                                                                                                                            2. calculate % of each student                                                                                                                                                      3. plot (bar and line graph) total  and % of each student(show value on each bar top)                                                                    4. add column 'result' 4. 4. showing status as pass/fail 
5. generate semester wise pie chart for result
